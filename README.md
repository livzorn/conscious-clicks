## ðŸŒŸ Conscious Clicks ðŸŒŸ

Browsing the internet can be a stressful experience. Conscious Clicks is an app to help you build better habits, unlearn unhealthy ideas, and think more critically about the content you see everyday. 

### How it works

- Create an account and choose what themes you'd like to focus on. We'll make you a beautiful homepage with a positive message that changes everyday. 

- Use this [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna/related) to set http://www.consciousclicks.org/ as your new tab page.

And voila! As you're working on your computer as usual, everytime you open a new tab, you'll see your calming, customized homepage with a message from the themes you've chosen. As you continually see these constructive messages, you'll begin to remember them, internalize them, and you'll retrain yourself to live more mindfully. It's as easy as that!

### Customize your homepage

- Add your big-picture goals so they're always in your awareness and you'll always be working toward them whether you realize it or not. 

- Keep track of your mental health by doing mood check-ins throughout the week and seeing your average mood per day on your calendar.

- Bookmark your go-to sites so you can easily click through from your homepage.

- Add message sets made by other users and even create your own when inspiration strikes!

### Happy Clicking!

Conscious clicks is coded in Ruby on Rails, with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and SQL.
